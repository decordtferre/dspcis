% INPUT:
% toplay     T1x1    Signal supplied as a column vector of T1 samples.
% fs         1x1     Sampling frequency [Hz].
% varargin:
% sync_pulse T2x1    Synchronization pulse (you can ignore this until
%                    exercise 6.1.1)
%
% OUTPUT:
% simin      T2x2   Signal to be supplied to recplay.mdl consisting of a
%                   signal to be played in column 1 and zeros in column 2.
% nbsecs     1x1    Length of simin [s].
